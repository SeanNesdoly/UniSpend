Our vision is to create a budgeting software system that is geared towards and built by students. The ability to quantify an individual's wealth given real-time input data and forecast a set of parameters into the near future provides the necessary tools that a full-time student requires to accurately and comfortably manage their funds. As students ourselves, occupying this niche market will allow us to develop a final product that fits effortlessly into a typical student's existing workflow. A flexible and event-driven model equips the end user with the most cost effective decisions at every step along the journey towards a post-secondary education.
